## Floor-MAR-included Policy Tree Optimization 

Surrogate based Flood-MAR modeling for Integreated management of the Folsom reservoir watershed using a policy tree optimization algorithm. 

The optimization algorithm was adopted from:
	Herman, J.D. and Giuliani, M. Policy tree optimization for threshold-based water resources 
	management over multiple timescales, Environmental Modelling and Software, 99, 39-51, 2018.
